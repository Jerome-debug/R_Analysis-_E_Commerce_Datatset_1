###Exploratory Data Analysis

1.  Defining the Question

<!-- -->

a)  Specifying the Data Analytic Question

Identifying the individuals likely to click on Ads

b)  Defining the Metric for Success Identifying iNdividulas who will likely click on Ads created

c)  Understanding the context

d)Recording the Experimental Design

e)  Data Relevance

<!-- -->

2.  Reading the Data

###Loading Our Datatset

```{R}
install.packages("data.table")
library("data.table")


advertising <- fread("http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData")

head(advertising)

```

3.  Checking the Data

```{R}

ncol(advertising)
```

```{r}



summary(advertising)
```

```{R}
###Finding the Statistical mean of numeric Columns


table(advertising$`Clicked on Ad`)


table(advertising$`Male`)
```

Equal Number of Clicks on Ads and Non clicks

There are more females to males in the sites,where 1 is Male,0 is Female

```{R}
###Finding the Minimum and Maximum Values on Numerical Columns

##Finding the  minimum values 

#Age column
advertising.Age.min   <- min  (advertising$Age)
advertising.Age.min



###$#$Finding the Max values in Our numerical Columns


#Age
advertising.Age.max   <- max  (advertising$Age)
advertising.Age.max


```

#The youngest Age is 19 and the Oldest age in the website cleint is 61

a)Validation

##Cleaning Our Dataset

```{R}

# Identifying Missing and Null Values
# ---
# 

View(advertising)
```

```{R}

any(is.na(advertising))



colSums(is.na(advertising))

```

There are no Null Values

###Checking for outliers

```{R}
boxplot(advertising$Age)


```

```{R}


boxplot(advertising$`Daily Internet Usage`)
```

```{R}

boxplot(advertising$`Area Income`)
```

There are a few outliers in our data on The Income column that doesnt affect our analysis

###Checking for duplicates

```{R}
#Checkcing for Duplicates and unique values


any(duplicated(advertising))

##Rows

duplicated_rows <- advertising[duplicated(advertising),]




duplicated_rows <- advertising[duplicated(advertising),]
duplicated_rows

```

```{R}

#Seeing Unique values



unique_items <- advertising[!duplicated(advertising), ]

unique_items




```

There are no Duplicates

###Univariate analysis

```{R}

table(advertising$`Clicked on Ad`)


table(advertising$`Male`)

```

```{R}

# Now, check whether this is a factor
is.factor(advertising$Clicked.on.Ad)

# Then, apply the factor function to create a factor from the vector
factor_data <- factor(advertising$Clicked.on.Ad) 

# Then see our newly created factor
factor_data 

# Check whether this is a factor
is.factor(factor_data)



```

```{R}


# display histogram
print(hist(advertising$Age))
```

#Observations

Minimum Age is 19 Maximum age is 61 People between the age of 20 and 50 appear more,

```{R}

# Fetching the age column
# ---
# 
Age <- advertising$Age

# Applying the table() function will compute the frequency distribution of the age variable
# ---
# 
age_frequency <- table(Age)

# Printing age_frequency below
# ---
#
age_frequency



```

```{R}




# Then applying the barplot function to produce its bar graph
# ---
# 
barplot(age_frequency)



```

Highest Age frequency is from the people in age 31,followed by,37,28,29

```{R}




print(hist(advertising$`Area Income`))


```

#Observations

Most people earn between 40,000 and 75,000 Very few people earn over 75,000 and below 35,000

```{R}


boxplot(advertising$`Daily Internet Usage`)


```

Usage lies between the 150th and 220th Mark ##Checking the Variable Male

```{R}
typeof(advertising$`Clicked on Ad`)
```

```{R}

# Now, check whether this is a factor
is.factor(advertising$Clicked.on.Ad)

# Then, apply the factor function to create a factor from the vector
factor_data <- factor(advertising$Clicked.on.Ad) 

# Then see our newly created factor
factor_data 

# Check whether this is a factor
is.factor(factor_data)

```

```{R}

# Fetching the school column
# ---
# 
Country <- advertising$Country

# Applying the table() function will compute the frequency distribution of the School variable
# ---
# 
country_frequency <- table(Country)

# Printing school_frequency below
# ---
#
country_frequency

```

####Bivariate Analysis

```{R}





plot( advertising$`Age`,advertising$`Daily Time Spent on Site`, xlab = "Age", ylab = "Daily time Spent on Sites ", col = "red")

```

People between the age 40 and below spend much time on the sites While people aged 50 and above spend less time on sites

```{R}

#create scatterplot of hours studied vs. exam score
plot(advertising$`Daily Internet Usage`, advertising$`Daily Time Spent on Site`, pch=16, col='steelblue',
     main=' Daily Internet Usage vs. Daily Time spent on site',
     xlab='Daily Internet Usage', ylab='Daily Time spent on site')

```

People with high daily internet usage spend higher time on sites

```{R}






plot(advertising$`Area Income` ,advertising$`Age`, xlab= "Clicked on Ad", ylab = "Age", col = "red")




```

People with high Area income are aged between 30 and Above

```{R}

plot( advertising$`Daily Time Spent on Site`,advertising$`Area Income`, xlab = "Daily time Spent on Sites ", ylab = "Area Income", col = "red")

```

People with High area income spend more time on sites

```{R}


plot( advertising$`Daily Internet Usage`,advertising$Age, xlab = "Daily time Spent on Sites ", ylab = "Age", col = "red")

```

People aged 30 and below have high internet usage

```{R}
#calculate correlation between Ads clickrf and Daily internet Usage
cor(advertising$`Clicked on Ad`, advertising$`Daily Internet Usage`)



```

There is a  negative correlation between the Daily internt usage and those indivuduals that click on Ads

```{R}
#calculate correlation between Ads clicked and Daily Time spent on site
cor(advertising$`Clicked on Ad`, advertising$`Daily Time Spent on Site`)



```

There is a  negative correlation between the Daily itime spent on sites and those indivuduals that click on Ads





###Conclusions 1 Equal Number of Clicks on Ads and Non clicks

2 There are more females to males in the sites,where 1 is Male,0 is Female 3 The youngest Age is 19 and the Oldest age in the website cleint is 61

4 Minimum Age is 19 Maximum age is 61 
5 Highest Age frequency is from the people in age 31,followed by,37,28,29

6 Most people earn between 40,000 and 75,000 Very few people earn over 75,000 and below 35,000 
7 Dail internet Usage lies between the 150th and 220th Mark ##Checking the Variable Male 
8 People between the age 40 and below spend much time on the sites While people aged 50 and above spend less time on sites 
9 People with high daily internet usage spend higher time on sites 
10 People with high Area income are aged between 30 and Above

11 People with High area income spend more time on sites

12 People aged 30 and below have high internet usage

###Recommendatations
1 Focus ad traffic to users aged 30 and below as they have high internet usage

2 Foucs on sending ads to individuals with high income as they spend more time on the sites

3 Send more ads to clients with high internet usage as theyre more likely to see the ads compared to the ones with less internet usaged

4 People aged 40 are a good client market for the ads because they alot of time on the sites
